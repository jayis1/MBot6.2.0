# MBot6.2.0


This project is a self-contained Discord music bot built with Python and discord.py, optimized for easy deployment on Debian-based systems (like Debian 12, or inside Proxmox/VMware).

The entire workflow is managed by a launch.sh script that automates the setup of a virtual environment, installation of dependencies (ffmpeg, libopus-dev, etc.), and execution of the bot in a persistent screen session. It provides a robust and feature-complete solution for self-hosting a music bot with minimal hassle.

For a detailed breakdown of the features, project structure, and installation steps, see the full documentation.
